 <h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>
 <table>
  <tr>
<h4>Can you work with me if I'm far away from you?</h4>
<p>Yes! We've worked with dozens of satisfied farms and local food groups across the U.S. and Canada.<br> We'll stay in touch along the way via email, phone, video calls, and/or text — whichever methods you prefer.</p>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <h4>How much do you charge?</h4>
    <p>We offer a range of options, including new budget-friendly e-commerce packages, high-end custom website development, and a full range of other marketing services — get in touch and we’ll send a menu of services with current pricing.</p>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <h4>What do I have to do to get ready?</h4>
        <p>The first step is to just get in touch, and from there we'll make it as easy as possible for you. We can work with text and images you already have, or we can start from scratch.</p>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <h4>Can you help my farm with online ordering?</h4>
            <p>Yes! We’re a Local Line Certified Partner, a GrazeCart Consultant, a Shopify Partner, a Squarespace Circle member, and we’re Square Online Certified. We also work on Weebly, Wix, and Wordpress websites, among others. 

              If you’d like help choosing a farm e-commerce platform, we’ll start by asking about your current sales model and your farm’s specific needs. Then we’ll make a recommendation of the best-fit farm website platform to meet those needs — whether they include variable weight meat cuts, aggregated produce pick lists, CSAs, half pig deposits, home delivery, pre-order for pickup, ordering lead time windows and cutoffs, shipping, and just about anything else. 
              
              We have a GIANT spreadsheet of every platform and nearly every feature they offer, and if there’s anything you need that we haven’t pinned down yet, we’ll figure it out!</p>
